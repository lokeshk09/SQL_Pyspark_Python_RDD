# SQL_Pyspark_Python_RDD

Detailed Notebook of writing same code logic in SQL, Pyspark, Python, RDD




# Hi, I'm Lokesh! ðŸ‘‹ I Created this repo to Learn Pyspark with examples


## Getting Started

Here i have created few Notebooks where i have used same code logic in below different Languages to get the same output.

- SQL
- Pyspark
- Python
- RDD

Sometimes we might need to know how the same SQL code can be re-written in other languages, so i tried to gather information and consolidated in a single repo.

For this Exercise i have used Databricks Community Edition. where we'll get free limited resources for practicing.
